# Nox-Browser
This is a basic web browser created using Python and PyQt5.
It hosts a special feature of reference mode that can be used to 
record the websites one has visited during a particular chosen period of time. 
The entire pycharm folder has been uploaded to: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lz_O-FBiJSVau3Gv4k9WmG2LiEMOWm12?usp=sharing

Note: One has to install PyQt5, QWebEngine, datetime etc packages before running the code. Nox.py is the main file. And get the image folder from the google drive link.
